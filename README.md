DynamOCR is the result of me playing around with the open source [Tesseract](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract) library. This package exposes a node for use in the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.org) visual programming environment. 


## Current Version
DynamOCR is a work in progress and is currently built against the latest Dynamo build. At this time that is 2.5.0.

## Contributors
This package is currently managed by author of http://sixtysecondrevit.com.

## Updates
We shall see if I finish this out.
